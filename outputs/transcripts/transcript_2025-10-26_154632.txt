Now I'm going to bed. Good night. I'm going to turn you off and I'm going to go to bed because I've had a marathon and I've got no fucking usage left until Wednesday and I need to use it. So yeah, good night. God bless. Turned out fucking chat GPT was a pile of shit in the end. Anyway, couldn't sort of fucking shit out. He's just he's just got a posture in any like a lot. Yeah, I just do it like this. But we fucking did it properly.
 It feels like a better win now. Now we, you know, we took our time and we got the, you know, ups and downs. That's what makes it fucking you can tell within the product. The product's fucking awesome. That sound bar is brilliant. We just need to extend it a bit. And it's a lot more funky than the other one than this shitty super with sport. It's all that black and white minimal crap. It's boring now.
