Yo, do you hear what I'm saying? What I'm trying to say is that you need to be able to what you need to be able to do is use the refresh as a trigger as an event and then it'll just paste directly in because you're right it hasn't finished being updated in a database yet that's why it's not it's doing the last no command so you need to give it a few more seconds and I wouldn't time it because that might change
 depending on a few factors so just use the refresh as the trigger in a loop when refresh trigger this event paste it into what on focus finished if not do nothing you know just go back and refresh the page that's it you just need to put the refresh you need to put that that the paste command on focus in a in a
 what's it called in a in a in a in a in a lack it embedded into that fucking logic in a loop in a in a in a if then statement or whatever they called you know if if this condition is true the refresh then paste the fucking stored value if there is no stored value or if there is no focus then don't bother that simple
 that's what the fucking super whispers doing
